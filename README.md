# Fantasy Football Draft Analyst (MCP Server)

A live draft assistant. Connect it to Claude, sync your ESPN or Sleeper draft board, and
ask "who should I pick?" at every turn. It answers with a recommendation, the reasoning,
and the odds each player survives to your next pick.

Tested end to end against live data: **631 players** (551 veterans, 80 rookies) modelled
from **247,284 plays** across five seasons, priced against real 2026 preseason consensus.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zacharytran26/Fantasy-Football-Draft-MCP.git
cd Fantasy-Football-Draft-MCP

# Use a virtual environment (required on macOS with Homebrew Python, and
# recommended everywhere else) -- see docs/quickstart.md if `pip`/`python`
# aren't found or you hit "externally-managed-environment".
#
# If this repo lives under an iCloud-synced folder (Desktop or Documents on
# macOS), put the venv somewhere NOT synced instead, e.g. ~/.venvs/ffdraft-mcp
# -- see docs/troubleshooting.md for why.
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .

# One-time data build (~3-6 min; downloads 5 seasons, then caches)
python setup_data.py
```

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fantasy-draft": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/ff-draft-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "ffdraft.server"],
      "env": {
        "FFDRAFT_SEASON": "2026",
        "ESPN_SWID": "optional-for-private-espn-leagues",
        "ESPN_S2": "optional-for-private-espn-leagues",
        "PYTHONPATH": "/absolute/path/to/ff-draft-mcp/src"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use absolute paths for both `command` and `PYTHONPATH` — Claude Desktop launches the server
from an undefined working directory, so plain `python` or relative paths won't resolve.
`PYTHONPATH` is a deliberate belt-and-suspenders: on macOS with Python 3.13, an editable
install's `.pth` file can end up with the OS "hidden" flag set (cause varies), and Python
3.13 silently skips hidden `.pth` files at startup, which breaks the `ffdraft` import even
though `pip install -e .` succeeded. Pointing `PYTHONPATH` straight at `src/` sidesteps that
mechanism entirely. See [troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) if the server still
doesn't appear.

Then in Claude:

```
Set up my home league: 10 teams, full PPR, I pick 4th.
Set up my work league: 13 teams, half PPR, I pick 11th.
Switch to home. Sync my Sleeper draft 1234567890. Who should I pick?
```

## What it does

**Recommends picks by opportunity cost, not raw value.** Knowing a player is good is
easy; knowing whether he'll still be there at your next turn is what decides who to take
now. For each position the model walks the board top-down, accumulating the probability
every better player is gone, and values a pick by its marginal gain over waiting.

At pick 6 with the top five off the board, that means recommending Amon-Ra St. Brown over
Josh Allen — Allen grades as the highest-value player left, but has a 73% chance of
lasting to pick 19, and the receiver has 8%.

**Projects players from five seasons of open data.** Offensive line from adjusted line
yards and pressure allowed, neutral-script pace and run/pass split, five-year defensive
strength by position, divisional schedule, injury history crossed with workload burden,
positional aging curves. Computed from raw plays rather than scraped from ranking tables,
so it recomputes under your scoring and doesn't break when a website changes its HTML.

**Optimises for consistency.** The default leans toward week-to-week reliability over
raw ceiling. Tune it with one number.

**Handles your actual leagues.** PPR, half PPR, standard, superflex, TE premium, any
size, any slot. Multiple leagues side by side with separate boards and drafts.

**Separation and route efficiency** from NGS tracking data — the open-data stand-in for
paywalled charting. Validated against a published PFF table: TPRR within a few
hundredths, ordering correct.

**Rookies** projected from draft capital, fitted to ten years of first-year outcomes.

**Live sync** from Sleeper (public API, no credentials), ESPN, or paste from anywhere.

**Name matching** that survives real drafts — `JSN`, `CMC`, `Bijan`, `Hollywood Brown`,
`Joshua Palmer`, and typos. Ambiguous names name their candidates rather than guessing.
