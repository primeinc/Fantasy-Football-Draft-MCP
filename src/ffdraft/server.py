    you already hold at the same position with the same bye week, and half that
    for other positions. Default 0; who_should_i_pick reports bye_week and
    bye_conflicts either way.

    td_luck_weight controls how hard a player's red zone touchdown rate gets
    regressed toward what his position converts on average (player_report shows
    rz_touches/rz_td/rz_td_rate/rz_baseline_rate so you can see the raw numbers
    behind the adjustment). Set it to 0 to score players on raw history with no
    touchdown-luck correction at all.

    qb_boost is different from the others: they all adjust the projection from a
    real per-player signal (O-line, pace, etc.); qb_boost is a direct fractional
    lift on QB draft_score you supply because you believe the position is worth
    more than the projection says, not because of any single player's own inputs.
    Comes from champion_strategies/draft_backtest analysis: check whether QB has
    actually beaten its draft cost across your league's real history (not just
    hit rate in general -- that alone doesn't justify this) before setting it
    above 0. It stacks with, and doesn't replace, the roster-need discount that
    already stops the model from wanting a second QB once you have one.

    coverage_trend_weight is the same kind of supplied belief as qb_boost, and
    also defaults to 0. It rewards WR/TE with a short-area profile (high TPRR,
    low aDOT) over boundary/vertical receivers, and RBs with real receiving role
    (target_share), on the theory that 2025's shift to zone coverage and, later,
    back to base personnel (linebackers instead of nickel corners covering the
    slot/backfield) favors those archetypes. Unlike separation or td_luck, this
    isn't backed by a per-player real signal this project can backtest -- open
    data has no man/zone or personnel-package split (see separation.py) -- so
    treat any nonzero value as an opinion you're choosing to weight in, not a
    validated adjustment, and re-check the underlying rates each season.
