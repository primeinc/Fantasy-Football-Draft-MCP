"""Separation and route efficiency.

The PFF chart you shared (SEP score, YPRR/TPRR split by man and zone) is licensed
manual charting. But most of what it measures is recoverable from open data:

  * **Separation** — NFL Next Gen Stats publishes `avg_separation`, the tracking-measured
    distance in yards between receiver and nearest defender at the moment the pass
    arrives. That is the same underlying quantity as PFF's SEP, from player tracking
    chips rather than human charting.
  * **Cushion** — how far off the defender lines up pre-snap. Reads coverage respect.
  * **YPRR / TPRR** — need routes run, which no free source publishes directly. Routes
    are estimated as snap share times team dropbacks, which tracks true route counts
    closely for perimeter receivers.

What genuinely cannot be reproduced is the man-versus-zone split: that requires
per-play coverage classification, which only manual charting provides.
